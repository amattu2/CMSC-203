# Project 6
The 6th project of the semester and certainly the largest. Create a Movie Ticket Manager based on very little details. A majority of the other files are based off of my interpretation of the instructions. It includes a GUI (JavaFX, MovieTicketManagerFXController.java) and a series of test cases. 

# Project Outline
TBD

# Notes
The following files were NOT produced by me, and belong to their original authors: MovieTicketManager.java, tickets.txt, MovieTicketManagerTest.java
